# MINOR-PROJECT
"This is my inaugural website project, meticulously crafted using HTML and styled entirely with CSS. A key feature of this site is the custom-designed slide bar, which demonstrates a foundational understanding of CSS styling and interactive elements. This project serves as a significant milestone in my web development journey, showcasing the ability to implement visual components and control layout through Cascading Style Sheets."
